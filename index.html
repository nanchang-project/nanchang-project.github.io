            <p>
                Welcome to the GEDmatch Day website. This means you already did a DNA test or you're thinking about doing one. In both cases we're here to help you get the most out of your test.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are many different reasons to test DNA. We will be focussing on finding relatives for Chinese adoptees. As not every adoptee tested with the same company and not all companies allow uploads you will miss out on matches. Here’s where GEDmatch comes in.

            <h2>What is GEDmatch?</h2>
            <p>
                GEDmatch is a free DNA comparison and analysis website for people who have tested their autosomal DNA using a direct-to-consumer genetic testing company, such as Ancestry, 23andMe, FTDNA, or have a custom file from other sources. Testers download their DNA data file from the testing company, and then upload it to GEDmatch. GEDmatch processes the file, adds it to a genealogical database, and provides applications for matching and further analysis. Because GEDmatch aggregates files from all testing companies, your potential for matches is greater.
            </p>
            <p>
                Did you know GEDmatch contains over 1100 Chinese birth families?

            <p>
                For beginning users the most important column to check is the Gen column.
                The Gen column provides a rough estimate of the number of generations between you and the Most Recent Common Ancestor (MRCA) you and that match both share. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In the generation listing your parent or child is 1, an aunt or niece is about 1.5, a grandparent is 2. For cousins subtract one from the number, so if it shows generations of 4, the suggestion is 3rd cousin.
            </p>
            <div>
                <p>Gen 1 for parent-child,</p>
                <p>Gen 2 for 2 generations (grandparent-grandchild), etc.</p>

                When you have a close match, remind yourself contact can be in many forms. From knowing how to reach each other or sending a picture every now and then to visiting each other IRL.
                Follow the pace you're comfortable with.

        </p>
        <p>Contact your travel group and tell them about GEDmatch and this website.</p>

            <h2>Script for Top 10 DNA Matches</h2>
            <p>Hi [Match’s Name],</p>
            <p>I wanted to reach out because you are one of my top 10 DNA matches in this database and I was wondering if you’ve ever considered uploading your DNA results to GEDmatch?</p>
            <p>We all have different reasons for DNA testing - I was adopted from China and would love to find my birth family [or change to include your reason]. GEDmatch expands your search beyond a single testing platform, increasing the chances of finding relatives you didn't know existed. With over 1,100 Chinese birth families registered there, the platform has been a beacon of hope for many looking to reunite with their roots.</p>
            <p>Even if you were not adopted, having your DNA in GEDmatch would allow you to connect with biological relatives that may have used other testing platforms. You may even be able to provide assistance to someone else who is curious about their roots!</p>
            <p>I uploaded my DNA results to GEDmatch in 2021 and it provided me with many answers I was looking for. [something about personal experience]</p>
            <p>It is completely free to upload your data file there. You just have to download your raw data from [testing company] first. You can start your journey here: [insert GEDmatch link]. Let me know if you have any questions! </p>
            <p>Wishing you the very best on this meaningful adventure.</p>
            <p>Warm regards,</p>

                <p>
                    Nanchang Project exists to serve the community of Chinese adoptees who are searching for biological relatives in China. Our organization was founded in February 2018 by two adoptive moms with children from Nanchang, Jiangxi province. In the ensuing months, they traveled to China to publicize their search, and the Project quickly grew to represent adoptees from all areas of China. In October 2022, we welcomed our first adoptee in a leadership role as Co-Director. Today, Nanchang Project’s team has grown in size with members based all over the world. We are on track to become the first fully adoptee-led organization of its kind that focuses on reconnecting international adoptees with their roots and birth families in China. To date, we have made 50 matches between searching Chinese families and children who were adopted abroad and provided 300 DNA tests to birth relatives. Besides offering free DNA tests to Chinese families, our programming for adoptees include Nanchang Project trips to China, Origins Searches, Toutiao Article Program (TAP), document translation, community events, guidance, and more.

                <h3>The Roots of Love</h3>
                <p>The Roots of Love (ROL) is a volunteer-based initiative of adoptees and adoptive parents dedicated to helping Chinese adoptees who want to find their biological parents. It is based on the global humanitarian desire to reunite families that have been separated, due to a variety of personal and collective circumstances.</p>
                <p>We believe that adoptees have the fundamental right to search for the parents from whom they were separated, and thus, possibly, replace the unknown of their birth by a family lineage. We would like to help adoptees fill a large gap in the makeup of their human identity.</p>
                <p>Our mission is to contribute, one reconnected adoptee at a time, to a happier and more unified humanity. We believe that facilitating and expanding loving relationships between individuals, between families, and between nations is a key factor of collective evolution.</p>
